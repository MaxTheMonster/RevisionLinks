        Maximum Revision was a project which I began in late August. It has since then grown into one of my main projects. I intend for this to be a source for GCSE revision resources and notes. For those curious, this is open source and the code lies <a href="https://github.com/maxthemonster/RevisionLinks/">here.</a>
